## Project Description

The device is built for the interactive game “Flip That Digit.” The purpose of the game is that the user must flip the ordered switch corresponding to the number shown on the seven segment display with a streak display, which increments each correct response. The game runs continuously: a new, randomly generated target between zero and nine appears after each correct answer until they timeout or complete a streak of 10. The target number is the leftmost seven-segment position on the display, whereas the current streak count is the rightmost seven-segment position.
